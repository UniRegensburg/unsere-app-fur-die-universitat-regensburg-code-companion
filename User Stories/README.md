# User Stories

User stories describe features from the perspective of an end user and can help with identifying problems and
understanding the context of the system.

- As a student who likes to work on their laptop on campus, **I want to be able to use my phone as a second screen which
can view my current programming tasks**, so that I do not need to switch windows on my laptop as often.

- As a student who wants to improve their coding, **I want to see feedback for my code and suggestions for improvements**,
so that I can identify my errors and work on them.

- As a student with a tight time budget, **I want to see how much time I spend on my coding assignments**, so that I can 
plan other activities accordingly.

- As a user, **I want the pairing of my devices to work without much work on my side**, so that I can get into coding as 
fast as possible.
 
- As a student who often forgets deadlines, **I want to be reminded of upcoming due dates**, so that I can turn in my work
in time.
