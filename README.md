# Code Companion

## Concept
The Goal of the Project is to provide realtime Coding assistance on a second screen to help Beginners.

## Implementation

The Project consists of a Plugin for the Jetbrains IntelliJ Platform (Plugin Marketplace Link) and a connecting Android App (Google Play Link).
This App shows the Current tasks, Compiler Errors and Coding Statistics.
